One day  a boy named Joe was walking his dog. All of the sudden, a squirrel jumped out of a bush and the dog ran after
it. The leash was torn out of Joe’s hand and the dog chased the squirrel into the woods. Joe began to run after them, 
afraid he was going to lose his dog.

He ran almost a mile through the woods until he finally found his dog. However, when he found his dog, he had completely 
lost interest in the squirrel and was now staring up the tree at an owl. The owl peered back at the dog, and the dog 
desparately tried to climb to the owl. Suddenly the owl took flight.

As the owl took flight, Joe's dog started running again. It was getting dark, and Joe did not want to be in the woods this
late. He was trying his best to not lose sight of his dog. As he ran behind his dog, his dog began to slow down and look 
around trying to find the owl. Eventually Joe's dog lost interest in the owl and came back to Joe. Joe now realized he was
lost in the woods.

Almost no light was making it's way through the canopy, and Joe's dog was whimpering. His phone's battery was almost out
as well, leaving him in a terrible predicament. Then suddenly, a voice called from a path to his right- a voice that
sounded awfully like his mother's. 

Joe's hearing was pretty good, because it turned out to actually be Joe's mother. She guided him and his dog out of the
woods and then they all went to go get ice cream. "Good thing that wasn't anything scarey," Joe thought. "Or that story
may have been much longer." And they all lived happily ever after. The End.
