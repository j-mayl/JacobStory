One day  a boy named Joe was walking his dog. All of the sudden, a squirrel jumped out of a bush and the dog ran after it. The leash was torn out of Joe’s hand and the dog chased the squirrel into the woods. Joe began to run after them, afraid he was going to lose his dog.

He ran almost a mile through the woods until he finally found his dog. However, when he found his dog, he had completely lost interest in the squirrel and was now staring up the tree at an owl. The owl peered back at the dog, and the dog desparately tried to climb to the owl. Suddenly the owl took flight.
